There is no Fortran equivalent.

## Introduction

This exercise involves optimising a simple
image-processing algorithm using OpenCL.
It is an iterative reverse-edge-detection code that,
given a data file containing the output from running
a very simple edge detector on an image, reconstructs
the original source image. You will be given OpenCL
source files containing all of the necessary support
code and a working, but slow, GPU
implementation of the algorithm. Your task is to apply various
optimisations to the code to improve performance, as described below.


### Algorithm
You will be given a data file that represents the output
from a very simple edge-detection algorithm applied to a
greyscale image of size $M \times N$. The edge pixel values are constructed from the image using

$$
edge_{i,j} = image_{i-1,j} + image_{i+1,j} + image_{i,j-1} +
image_{i,j+1} - 4 \ image_{i,j}
$$

If an image pixel has the same value as its four surrounding
neighbours (i.e., no edge) then the value of $edge_{i,j}$
will be zero. If the pixel is very different from its four
neighbours (i.e., a possible edge) then $edge_{i,j}$ will be
large in magnitude. We will always consider $i$ and $j$ to
lie in the range $1,2, \ldots M$ and $1,2, \ldots N$ respectively.
Pixels that lie outside this range (e.g., $image_{i,0}$ or $image_{M+1,j}$)
are simply considered to be set to zero.

The exercise is actually to do the reverse operation and
construct the initial image given the edges. This is a
slightly artificial thing to do, and is only possible
given the very simple approach used to detect the edges
in the first place. However, it turns out that the reverse calculation is
iterative, requiring many successive stencil operations each. This is
similar to the edge-detection calculation itself:

$$
image_{i,j} = (image_{i-1,j} + image_{i+1,j} + image_{i,j-1} +
image_{i,j+1} - edge_{i,j})/4 
$$

The fact that calculating the image from the edges requires
a large amount of computation makes it a much more suitable
program than edge detection itself for the purposes of GPU
acceleration and performance measurement.

This inverse operation is also very similar to a large number
of real scientific HPC calculations that solve partial differential
equations using iterative algorithms such
as Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel.


### Practical

Navigate to find the template source code in
<code>exercises/opencl-optimise/reverse.c</code>.
There should be an accompanying kernel template <code>kernels.c</code>.
You will need to do this in a separate tab or window.

Please read on for instructions. Where necessary, it may be helpful to
refer to the OpenCL reference guide
[https://www.khronos.org/files/opencl22-reference-guide.pdf](https://www.khronos.org/files/opencl22-reference-guide.pdf)



### Optimisation

You are provided with a working OpenCL implementation of the
algorithm in the `reverse.c` and `kernels.cl` files.
You will find three kernels in the second source file;
one of these `inverseEdgeDetect1D_col` is already complete
and functional the other two will be completed later on in
the optimisation process. The source file `reverse.c`
contains the top-level program, some support code for file
I/O and timing, and a simple host implementation of the
algorithm to check the result.

In the host code, the image data arrays are two-dimensional,
which maps intuitively onto the two dimensions of the image.
A one pixel wide halo region of zeroes is added to each edge;
this simplifies the computation as it allows the edge pixels
to be treated in the same manner as other pixels (the `edge`
array, which holds the original data, does not have a halo
as it does not need one). For the kernel, the data arrays
are flattened to a single dimension but are otherwise the
same format.

The complete kernel, `inverseEdgeDetect1D_col`, assigns each
row of the image to its own OpenCL work item. The kernel
contains a loop over the columns of the image, determines
the element index that it should work on (getting the column
from the loop counter and the row from the OpenCL global ID),
and processes that pixel as described above.

As the algorithm is iterative, there is a loop in the
top-level program that invokes the kernel a number of times.
In between the kernel invocations it copies the output from
the previous invocation  back to the input buffer ready for
the next iteration, via a buffer in host memory.



### Remove unnecessary data transfers

Notice that in the main loop of our code, the data is copied
from GPU memory to host memory and then back to GPU memory at
each iteration. This is not in fact necessary with the
exception of the final iteration when the data must be
copied back to the host. Therefore, we can avoid most of
the data copying by simply reversing the roles of the input
and output buffers in device memory after each iteration
(the relevant `cl_mem` entities need to be swapped via a
`tmp` variable).

Once you have made these changes, run the code again and take
note of the time taken by the GPU version. How does it compare
to the previous timing?




```bash
# Execute this command to compile the code.
$ make
```

```bash
# To submit a batch job
$ qsub submit.sh
```


### Memory access

There is another bottleneck in the implementation of the
algorithm as provided. The GPU performs best when work items
are reading from adjacent memory locations, allowing some of
the memory reads to be combined (coalesced). However, in our
code, the threads are reading not from consecutive addresses
but from different rows of the image, so no coalescing can
take place.

This can be improved by decomposing the problem in a different
way. Instead of having each work item process one row of the
image data and loop over the pixels within that row, we can
have each work item process one column of the image and loop
over the rows of that column. This means that the work items
will always be reading consecutive memory locations allowing
the reads to be coalesced.

This is implemented in the `inverseEdgeDetect1D_row` kernel,
which needs two changes to make it complete:

1. determine the column index `col` for the thread using
  an appropriate OpenCL function call;
2. loop over all the rows of the image.


Try running the code with the new kernel (remember to change
the main loop to invoke the new kernel and provide suitable
global and local sizes for it). How does the performance
compare to the previous version?

### Occupancy


You should have seen a noticeable improvement in performance
as a result of the changes you made to reduce data transfers between the host and the device and to enable coalescing.
However, the current solution is still sub-optimal as it may
not create sufficient work items to utilise all the SMs on the
GPU --- it may have low occupancy.

OpenCL supports 1-, 2- or 3-dimensional decompositions; here
a 2D decomposition maps most naturally onto the pixels of an
image so this is what we will use.

A 2D version of the kernel is included: `inverseEdgeDetect2D`.
It requires two additional lines of code to make it work:

1. calculate the column index `col` from the first dimension
  of the OpenCL work item ID information;
2. calculate the row index `row` from the second dimension of
  the OpenCL work item ID information.

Notice that there is no longer a loop within the kernel, as
each work item is now operating on an individual pixel;
otherwise it is the same.

### Investigate the work group size

Once you have the 2D kernel working correctly, you can try altering the work group size. This are defined by constants
`LOCAL_W` and `LOCAL_H`  near the top of the main program.
Some suggested sizes to try are 8x8, 16x16 and 32x12. Note
that the total number of work items (threads) per work group
(block) should not exceed 1024 (the product of the local
"width" and "height").



### Keeping a copy of your work

If you wish to keep a copy of your work from this exercise remember to download both the driver source `reverse.c` and the file containing the kernels `kernels.cl`.
